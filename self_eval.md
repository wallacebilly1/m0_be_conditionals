# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
When we need to compare two (or more) variables.
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I couldn't remember how to run code within VS Code so spent a bunch of time trying to figure out a workaround. I wish I would've checked my "terminal commands" note instead of running around like a chicken with my head cut off.
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I loved getting to solve the challenges.  Always good to see something you code work out and multiple pieces of learning come together.
